# Skills Survey

A very simple skills survey that asks each responder to rate their
skill with a list of technologies using one of a small number of
predefined responses. By default these are 'No knowledge', 'Basic
familiarity', 'Comfortable knowledge', 'Experienced' and 'Expert'. The
levels and technologies are easily configured in literal arrays at the
top of the script.
